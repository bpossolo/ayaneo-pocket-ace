# Redream
Sega Dreamcast emulator... superceded by [Flycast](/flycast.md).

Redream used to be an open-source project (hosted on GitHub) but the developer decided to monetize the application and moved it into a private repository on GitLab.  

- [Official Site](https://redream.io)
- [GitLab Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/inolen/redream)
- [GitHub repository - defunct](https://github.com/inolen/redream)

In order to play Dreamcast games at higher resolutions (1080p+), you have to pay to upgrade it.  

I set up Redream but then decided to use [Flycast](/flycast.md) instead because it's completely free and seems to be much more configurable.  

## Installation
